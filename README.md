### This is what I have done so far
### I will keep on updating it, 

Stage 1: Done
1) Calculate % growth of funding between year 2008 & 2009.
2) If funding is positive, tag it as 1, if funding is negative tag it as 0. This is the target variable.

Stage 2: Almost Done
1) Create graphs of univariate distribution of all non funding variables and share on a jupyter notebook. Just FYI - Funding FY2008, FY2009, FY2010 are the "funding variables"
2) Calculate mutual_info_score of target variable created in stage 1 & ALL non funding variables and share on a jupyter notebook.
